The United States government periodically collects demographic information by conducting a census.

In this problem, we are going to use census information about an individual to predict how much a person earns -- in particular, whether the person earns more than $50,000 per year. This data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult).

The file [census.csv](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/asset-v1:MITx+15.071x_3+1T2016+type@asset+block/census.csv) contains 1994 census data for 31,978 individuals in the United States.

The dataset includes the following 13 variables:

- _age =_ the age of the individual in years
- _workclass =_ the classification of the individual's working status (does the person work for the federal government, work for the local government, work without pay, and so on)
- _education =_ the level of education of the individual (e.g., 5th-6th grade, high school graduate, PhD, so on)
- _maritalstatus =_ the marital status of the individual
- _occupation =_ the type of work the individual does (e.g., administrative/clerical work, farming/fishing, sales and so on)
- _relationship =_ relationship of individual to his/her household
- _race =_ the individual's race
- _sex =_ the individual's sex
- _capitalgain =_ the capital gains of the individual in 1994 (from selling an asset such as a stock or bond for more than the original purchase price)
- _capitalloss =_ the capital losses of the individual in 1994 (from selling an asset such as a stock or bond for less than the original purchase price)
- _hoursperweek =_ the number of hours the individual works per week
- _nativecountry =_ the native country of the individual
- _over50k =_ whether or not the individual earned more than $50,000 in 1994

#### Problem 1.1 - A Logistic Regression Model

(1 point possible)

Let's begin by building a logistic regression model to predict whether an individual's earnings are above $50,000 (the variable "over50k") using all of the other variables as independent variables. First, read the dataset census.csv into R.

Then, split the data randomly into a training set and a testing set, setting the seed to 2000 before creating the split. Split the data so that the training set contains 60% of the observations, while the testing set contains 40% of the observations.

Next, build a logistic regression model to predict the dependent variable "over50k", using all of the other variables in the dataset as independent variables. Use the training set to build the model.

Which variables are significant, or have factors that are significant? (Use 0.1 as your significance threshold, so variables with a period or dot in the stars column should be counted too. You might see a warning message here - you can ignore it and proceed. This message is a warning that we might be overfitting our model to the training set.) Select all that apply.
